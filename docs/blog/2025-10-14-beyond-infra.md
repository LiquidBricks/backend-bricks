description: Unifying app logic and infrastructure under a single model of flow.

### 1. The Divide

Today, application logic and infrastructure live in separate worlds.
We use Terraform to define our resources, Kubernetes to deploy them, CI/CD tools to build and release them.
Each one does its job — but each speaks a different language of workflow.
The result? Context gets lost between layers. Systems stop flowing.

### 2. The Realization

Every tool we use — whether it’s Terraform, Jenkins, or Kubernetes — is really just a specialized workflow engine.
What if instead of gluing dozens of them together, we had one coherent substrate that spoke flow natively?
A single graph of dependencies that could represent not only infrastructure, but builds, deploys, data pipelines, and even user actions.

### 3. The Shift

The insight behind Component Service is simple: everything is a workflow.
Whether provisioning a server, building a container, training a model, or processing a form — it’s all a flow of data through dependent steps.
Once you see that, you stop writing scripts and start composing graphs.

### 4. The Unification

Kubernetes excels because it defines a standard for running containers.
React excels because it defines a standard for building interfaces.
Component Service aims to do the same for back-end workflows — a reactive, composable spec where tasks declare their inputs, outputs, and dependencies, and the system handles the rest.
Think of it as React for flow.

### 5. The Architecture

A Component Service workflow is not just a DAG — it’s a living circuit:

- Nodes are components (functions, services, jobs).
- Edges are data dependencies.
- Execution is event-driven (via NATS).
- State is event-sourced.
- Observability is built in: every flow emits logs, metrics, and traces automatically.
  Any node can reference another workflow, enabling composable, hierarchical systems — pipelines made of pipelines.

### 6. The Ecosystem Vision

Imagine a world where every backend framework exposes its workflows as components — standardized, introspectable, and connectable.
UIs become thin shells that send and receive data from these flows.
Teams stop building redundant orchestration logic.
New apps are born by wiring together existing flows.

### 7. The Philosophy

Infrastructure is not separate from application logic — it is application logic, viewed from another layer of abstraction.
By unifying both under a single model of flow, we collapse the distance between code, compute, and coordination.
The result is a system that explains itself — one where cause, effect, and intent are all visible.

### 8. The Manifesto Core

The future of software isn’t another platform.
It’s a standard for flow — the missing substrate that unites infrastructure, apps, and automation.
Component Service is that substrate.
